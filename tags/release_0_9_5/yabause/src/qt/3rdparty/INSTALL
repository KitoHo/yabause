    Basic Installation Overview:

	Step 1: Install the Linux Joystick Driver.
	Step 2: Install the Joystick Wrapper Library (libjsw).
	Step 3: Install the Joystick Calibrator.
	Step 4: Calibrate your Joystick(s).


    1. Install the Linux Joystick Driver: (Linux only)

	Note: Skip this step if you already have it installed. If you
	have Linux 2.2.15 or newer then you may already have the
	joystick drivers installed, check the directory:

		/lib/modules/<linux_version>/misc/*joy*

	As of Linux 2.6.x, check:

		/lib/modules/<linux_version>/kernel/drivers/input/joydev.ko
		/lib/modules/<linux_version>/kernel/drivers/input/joystick/
		/lib/modules/<linux_version>/kernel/drivers/input/joystick/analog.ko


	Download the Linux Joystick Driver 1.2.x at:

	http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/

	-or-

	ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/joystick/joystick-1.2.14.tar.gz

	Follow the instructions included in the Linux Joystick Driver.
	Rememeber to load the joystick driver modules and install the
	joystick.h header file in /usr/include/linux/joystick.h.


    2. Install the Joystick Wrapper Library (libjsw):

	Go to the `libjsw' subdirectory. Choose the most appropriate
	Makefile for your system and type `make -f <makefile>' to
	start the building process.

	If there were no errors, then type `make -f <makefile> install'
	(make sure you have root privlages).

	Note: FreeBSD users should use gmake (devel/gmake) instead of make.


    3. Build the Joystick Calibrator:

	Go to the `jscalibrator' subdirectory. Choose the most appropriate
	Makefile for your system and type `make -f <makefile>' to
	start the building process.

	If there were no errors, then type `make -f <makefile> install'
	(make sure you have root privlages).


    4. Calibrating your Joystick(s):

	Make sure that you have your Linux Joystick Driver installed
	properly and that the required modules are loaded. To load
	the driver, type:

	# modprobe joy-analog

	Or for Linux 2.6.x

	# modprobe joydev

	You can also specify arguments when loading the joystick driver,
	for example:

	# modprobe joy-analog js_an=0x201,1023,0

	Please read the Linux Joystick driver documentation for a list
	of available arguments.

	Now run jscalibrator to see if the driver was loaded properly:

	# jscalibrator &

	To open/select a joystick in jscalibrator, enter the joystick's
	device path in jscalibrator's Joystick Device path entry.
	Below is a list of joystick paths:

	/dev/js0				Analog Joystick 1
	/dev/js1				Analog Joystick 2
	/dev/js2				Analog Joystick 3
	/dev/js3				Analog Joystick 4
	/dev/input/js0				USB Joystick 1
	/dev/input/js1				USB Joystick 2
	/dev/input/js2				USB Joystick 3
	/dev/input/js3				USB Joystick 4

	Note that SDL and some other non-libjsw programs use
	/dev/input/event8, do not attempt to open the joystick device
	using this path in jscalibrator as the methods those programs
	use are not the same as jscalibrator.

	The logical layout (look in the view menu) offers more advanced
	and precise axis calibration options.

	If you are having trouble getting exact calibration values, then
	you can go to the logical layout and click on the axis's gauge
	and you will be prompted for exact calibration values.

                                                                 ======
                                                                 LIBJSW
