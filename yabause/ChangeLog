0.0.5 -> 0.0.6
 scu
  - added direct dma
 superh
  - added division unit
  - fixed endianess issue
 vdp2
  - added NBG3
  - fixed color bug

0.0.4 -> 0.0.5
 vdp2:
  - lot of work, the vdp2 is now capable of
    displaying the set-clock screen of the
    bios
 monitor/debugger:
  - added memory dump possibility

0.0.2 -> 0.0.4
 monitor/debugger:
  - added debugging possibility, can now pause/resume emulation
    and execute instructions step by step;
  - opcodes are disassembled interactively.
 general:
  - early emulations of different cpu/onchip modules: scu, vdp1
    and dmac;
  - translate most of the code from french to english;
  - added synchronisation between processors;
  - yabause is now using SDL, remove all fork/ipc code and use
    SDL_Thread instead.

0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
 sh2:
  - "mull" is now decoded;
  - changed the way the opcodes are decoded, now using a table with pointers
    to function, should be faster.
 intc:
  - now tests if the interrupt level is correct before accepting one.
 vdp2:
  - early emulation, just throws an interrupt every half-frame.
 general:
  - vdp1 and vdp2 are now synchronized with the master sh;
  - fixed some memory bug, all the shared memory allocated is de-allocated;
  - now using configure/make, should be more portable;
  - modified things to be more c++ and less linux/c.
