1 Introduction________________________________________________

Yabause is a Sega Saturn emulator under GNU GPL.

Be aware that this is an early alpha version. Don't expect to
play commercial games on your PC. This software is released
for testing purposes only, and is essentially aimed to
developers.


2 Installation instructions___________________________________

Yabause is written in C++ using the SDL librairy,
so you need a working C++ compiler, as g++ and the above
librairies runtime and development packages:

  * you can find SDL at http://www.libsdl.org/index.php in
    the download section.

Once these library installed, you should be ready to
install Yabause.

Uncompress the Yabause archive, move to the newly created
directory, type "./configure", then "make" , it will generate
one program: "yabause" in the "src" directory.

You can pass the --enable-debug option to the configure
script, Yabause will then print debug messages on the
error standard output.

You can even type "make install" to install that program on
your system (in /usr/local/ by default), then uninstalling is
done by typing "make uninstall".


3 How to use Yabause__________________________________________

The first requirement is a Saturn ROM BIOS image (hence a Sega
Saturn).

Execute "yabause -b /path/to/bios.bin". The program will open
a window, if you wait long enough, you will see the "set clock"
screen of the bios appear, that's all for time being.

If you want to see what's going inside, execute yabause with
the -d option and it will show a monitoring/control window
from which you can control yabause

The upper frame display the master sh2 registers, for the SR
register, the description of each part is give.

The down-left frame display the desassembled opcode (using
Bart Trzynadlowski's disassembler).

The down-right frame display the current opcode.

There is five command to control yabause, each command is
issued by typing it's initial letter:

  * m - memory dump
  * p - pause the emulator
  * q - quit the emulator
  * r - run (or resume) the emulator
  * s - step instruction one by one

For the memory dump, you can give the address to dump by
using the '0' to '9' and 'a' to 'f' letters.

You can load binaries with the -f or --bin option:
"yabause -b bios.bin -f demo.bin". In this case, yabause will
load "demo.bin" at address 0x06004000 and move the PC at this
same address (the bios is also loaded, but ignored).
