   - logo will not show if yabause is installed

 (2) EMULATION

   - what's happening at onchip address 4 ?
   - there should be synchro between smpc INTBACK and VBlank
   - check that dma operation is correct
   - finish intc, add others sources of interrupt
   - finish SCU
   - finish DMAC emulation
   - change sh2 interpreter into a dynamic recompiler
   - add SCI emulation
   - finish sleep/standby mode and implement the clock change pins
   - add vdp2 coefficient table emulation
   - add vdp2 line screen emulation
   - add mpeg decoding

 (3) MONITOR/DEBUGGER

   - add a command to dump memory
   - add a command to execute N instructions
   - implement a method to trace emulation
   - implement a rewind
   - add ability to set code and memory breakpoints
   - Each cpu should have some ability to return debugging information(e.g. VDP1 should return current commands as text, VDP2 should return screen info, etc.)
