  - rewrote entire code in C for portability and speed
  - fixed a number of configure bugs, added a few more command-line options
  - fixed code so it's 64-bit friendly
  - added iso and bin/cue files support
  - changed several parts of yabause to allow for multiple implementations of video, sound, and peripheral code.
  - added save states(currently broken unfortunately)
0.0.6 -> 0.0.7
 cd block:
  - added cd interface for porters.
  - whole bunch of cd commands were added. Most games should now
    start to boot.
  - added region auto-detection.
 mpeg card:
  - added basic emulation.
  - added mpeg rom loading support. 
 scsp:
  - bug fixes
 scu:
  - bug fixes
 smpc:
  - bug fixes
 superh:
  - fixed dma
  - lots of other bugfixes
  - opcode optimizations
 vdp1:
  - added sprite caching
  - added scaled sprites
  - added sprite color modes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  - macosx color bug fixed
  - bug fixes
 vdp2:
  - macosx color bug fixed
  - bug fixes
 general:
  - added fps counter
  - switched to OpenGL, removed SDL_gfx.
  - yui interface added. Now each port should be able to provide
    a nice custom ui.
  - threads removed, program should be more stable now.
  - added save ram loading ability
0.0.5 -> 0.0.6
 scu
  - added direct dma
 superh
  - added division unit
  - fixed endianess issue
 vdp2
  - added NBG3
  - fixed color bug

0.0.4 -> 0.0.5
 vdp2:
  - lot of work, the vdp2 is now capable of
    displaying the set-clock screen of the
    bios
 monitor/debugger:
  - added memory dump possibility

0.0.2 -> 0.0.4
 monitor/debugger:
  - added debugging possibility, can now pause/resume emulation
    and execute instructions step by step;
  - opcodes are disassembled interactively.
 general:
  - early emulations of different cpu/onchip modules: scu, vdp1
    and dmac;
  - translate most of the code from french to english;
  - added synchronisation between processors;
  - yabause is now using SDL, remove all fork/ipc code and use
    SDL_Thread instead.

0.0.1 -> 0.0.2
 sh2:
  - "mull" is now decoded;
  - changed the way the opcodes are decoded, now using a table with pointers
    to function, should be faster.
 intc:
  - now tests if the interrupt level is correct before accepting one.
 vdp2:
  - early emulation, just throws an interrupt every half-frame.
 general:
  - vdp1 and vdp2 are now synchronized with the master sh;
  - fixed some memory bug, all the shared memory allocated is de-allocated;
  - now using configure/make, should be more portable;
  - modified things to be more c++ and less linux/c.
