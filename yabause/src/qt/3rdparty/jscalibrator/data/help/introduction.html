<h2>Introduction To libjsw</h2>

<p>The libjsw system is a methoid for UNIX programs to interact with the
joysticks and other game controllers using a standardized methoid of input
and output. </p>

<p> The libjsw system consists of a library (<code>libjsw</code>) and
supporting programs such as <code>jscalibrator</code> that interact with
the libjsw system at the library level.</p>

<p>This makes possible, a common set of calibration and correction values
for all programs that use libjsw. There is also a version of
libjsw for Win32, enabling UNIX programs that use libjsw to be portable to
Windows. </p>


<a name="terminology">
<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>The libjsw system uses the following terms to describe calibration.</p>

<ul>

<li>Device Name - The libjsw system reffers to joysticks by their device
names, usually <code>/dev/js#</code> where <code>#</code> is a number. For
USB joysticks, the notation is <code>/dev/input/js#</code>. Note that
these device name notations match Linux <i>device file paths</i> for 
joysticks.

<li>Axis - Represents a one dimensional path of motion for a moveable part
on a joystick or any game controller. For example most joysticks have
atleast one stick that moves in two dimensions, this would count as two
axises. Newer joysticks have rotatable sticks, rudder pedals, throttles,
etc which will count as additional axises.

<li>Range of Motion - The range of motion is the set of values that an
axis can encompass. The range of motion consists of three primary
reference points; <i>minimum</i>, <i>center</i>, and <i>maximum</i>.
These points are usually determined through the process of calibration.

<li>Null Zone - A range of values near the <i>center</i> where the input
value from the physical joystick produces a 0 output value by libjsw. Some
axises can be set by the user to have no null zone what so ever.

<li>Correction Level - The libjsw system offers several levels of error
correction. The current supported values are 0, 1, and 2, where 0 specifies
no error correction and 2 specifies the maximum amount of error correction
supported (higher levels may be supported in the future). Error correction
involves libjsw checking an input value from the physical joystick,
correcting it, and then giving a modified/corrected output value.

<li>Dead Zone - A range of values defined by two bounds that are typically
very close to the <i>center</i>, this range of values are input values from
the physical joystick that are erratic and difficult to interprite. When
<i>correction level</i> is set to 0, this range of values are interprited
"as is". However if <i>correction level</i> is positive, then these values
will be "corrected" to the best that libjsw can. Higher levels of
<i>correction level</i> will produce better dead zone corrections. If the
entire or a part of the <i>dead zone</i> lies <u>within</u> the <i>null
zone</i>, then that entire or part of the <i>dead zone</i> will be 
interprited as 0 output.

<li>Correctional Coefficient - The maximum coefficient value used as 
corrected output when the input values are within the <i>dead zone</i>.
This only has affect when <i>correction level</i> is set to level 1 or
higher. See <a href="#error_correction">Error Correction</a> below.

</ul>


<a name="how_libjsw_works">
<h2>How libjsw Works</h2>

<p>libjsw calibrates joysticks using <code>jscalibrator</code> or any
compliant supporting software. See <a href="how_to_calibrate.html">How To
Calibrate</a> for instructions on using <code>jscalibrator</code> to
calibrate your joysticks. </p>

<p>Calibrated joystick values are usually stored in the file
<code>.joystick</code> located in the user's home directory. If you do not
have this file then you should run <code>jscalibrator</code> to calibrate
your joysticks for the first time. The Win32 version of libjsw stores the
calibration in the file <code>C:\WINDOWS\LIBJSW.INI</code> </p>

<p>When a program that uses the libjsw library runs and decides to open a
joystick using the libjsw library, libjsw first checks for the calibration
file and if it exists it will be loaded along with the joystick that the
program wants to open. The program can then request values from the
joystick through libjsw, libjsw can give either raw joystick values or
calibrated corrected output values (whichever the program wants). </p>

<p>Note that libjsw cannot provide calibrated and corrected output if the
calibration file does <u>not</u> exist. Remember to <u>calibrate your
joystick(s) first</u>, before running any program that uses libjsw. You may
also need to calibrate your joysticks periodically from time to time, since
the mechanical parts within a joystick may errode with time and use. </p>

<p>To learn how to write your own programs to use libjsw, see <code>man
JSIntro</code> or visit the libjsw home page at

</p>


<a name="error_correction">
<h2>Error Correction</h2>

<p>The libjsw system offers several layers of advanced error correction.
When <i>correction level</i> is set to level 1 or higher, libjsw
will take input values from the physical joystick and give corrected
output values for functions <code>JSGetAxisCoeff()</code> and
<code>JSGetAxisCoeffNZ()</code> (see <code>man JSGetAxisCoeff</code>
for programming information).
The correction that libjsw performs on the pipeline is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Get raw input values from joystick
 <li>Ignore if no change
 <li>If input value falls inside the <i>null zone</i> then output a value
of 0.
 <li>If input value falls inside the <i>dead zone</i> then correct it and
output the corrected value.
 <li>All else take input value and output a value based on the axis
position from the maximum as a coefficient.
</ol>

<p> The above are generalized outlines of what to expect with corrected
values, they do not represent the exact equations used by libjsw (inquire
with <a href="contacts.html">authors</a> about that). </p>

<p>
Below is a graph that represents the input versus output values using
error correction with a defined <i>null zone</i> and <i>dead zone</i>.
