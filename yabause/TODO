 (1) (KNOWN) BUGS

 (2) EMULATION

   - Add sh2 dynamic recompiler in addition to sh2 interpreter
   - Add SCI emulation
   - Finish sleep/standby mode and implement the clock change pins
   - Add vdp2 coefficient table emulation
   - Add vdp2 line screen emulation
   - Add mpeg decoding
   - Add proper vdp1 command timing
   - SMPC intback status should be returning correct reset flags
   - Add vdp2 windows
   - Add vdp1 clipping/windows
   - Make sure sh2 dma round robin priority is working correctly
   - SCU should be handling non-longword aligned DMA transfers
   - Convert CD Block code so it's capable of handling async transfers
   - Fix whatever is causing those strange pitch problems in the SCSP
   - Add scsp slot sbctl support as there's a few odd games that use it
   - Add support for scsp slot alternate/reverse looping

 (3) MONITOR/DEBUGGER

   - Each cpu should have some ability to return debugging information(e.g. VDP1 should return current commands as text, VDP2 should return screen info, etc.)
   - Should have a function for the vdp2 that allows a developer/user to view the bitmap/tiles from the debug window. It'd be nice if it was be saveable too.

 (4) OTHER

   - Get configure working with cygwin and mingw
   - Finalize Save State format
   - Support multiple languages
   - Improve Opengl texture handling
   - Add a screenshot function for those too lazy to use the print-screen function
   - If using region autodetection and there's no CD in the drive it fails. Should be able to detect the region from MPEG card and Action Replay
