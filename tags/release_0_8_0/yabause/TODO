 (1) (KNOWN) BUGS

 (2) EMULATION

   - Add sh2 dynamic recompiler in addition to sh2 interpreter

   - Add vdp2 windows
   - Add vdp1 clipping/windows
   - Make sure sh2 dma round robin priority is working correctly
   - SCU should be handling non-longword aligned DMA transfers

 (3) MONITOR/DEBUGGER

   - Each cpu should have some ability to return debugging information(e.g. VDP1 should return current commands as text, VDP2 should return screen info, etc.)

 (4) OTHER

   - Get configure working with cygwin and mingw
   - Finalize Save State format
   - Support multiple languages
   - Improve Opengl texture handling
   - Allow user to remap peripheral controls
