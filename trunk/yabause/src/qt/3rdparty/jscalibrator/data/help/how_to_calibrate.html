<h2>Axis Layouts</h2>

<p>
<code>jscalibrator</code> features two methoids for calibrating
joysticks; <i>representative</i> or <i>logical</i>
axis layout.
</p>

<p>
The <i>representative</i> axis layout (depicted below) shows a diagram
of what a typical joystick looks like with cross hairs and ticks indicating
the current axis positions. The solid circle in the smaller top grid
represents the hat, the big grid in the center represents the standard
x and y axises, the vertical bar on the right represents the throttle
axis, and the horizontal bar on the bottom represents the rotate or
steering wheel axis.
</p>

<p>
The above methoid of calibration is usually the easiest and fastest but
lacks the ability the set precise specifications.
</p>

<p>
Logical layout (depicted below) offers a more advanced level 
of calibration. Each axis is presented as a separate line with
its current position and attributes. The horizontal window with an arrow 
pointing down along a ruler is called the <i>axis 
gauge</i>, the ruler ticks are in units of 25% where the center
tick is 0% and the left and right most ticks are -100% and 100% 
(respectivly).
</p>

<img src="logical_axis_layout.png">

<p>
Each axis has the following attributes (as shown below);
<i>null zone</i>, <i>correction level</i>, <i>dead zone</i> (min &amp;
max), <i>correctional coefficient</i>, etc. Reffer to the
<a href="introduction.html#terminology">Introduction</a> for
definitions on these attributes.
</p>

<a name="representative_calibration">
<h2>Representative Calibration</h2>

<p>
To calibrate using the <i>representative axis layout</i>, first click on
the Representative tab as needed to get to the representative axis layout
page. Next click on the <img src="calibrate_button1.png"> toggle button to
begin calibrating.
</p>

<p>
Move all axises through their full range of motion (including the hats if
you have them) and return all axises to their <i>centers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Click on the <img src="calibrate_button1.png"> toggle button again to
process the calibrated values and end calibration (this may take a few
seconds).
</p>

<p>
The <i>null zone</i> and other parameters will be set by the program to
their most useable values. If these values are not satisfactory or you
wish to set additional parameters, then you should perform a calibration
using the <i>logical axis layout</i> (see next section).
</p>


<a name="logical_calibration">
<h2>Logical Calibration</h2>

<p>
To calibrate using the <i>logical axis layout</i>, first click on the
Logical tab as needed to get to the logical axis layout page. Next click
on the <img src="calibrate_button2.png"> toggle button next to the axis
you want to calibrate to begin calibrating that axis.
</p>

<p>Move just that axis through its full range of motion and then return it
to its <i>center</i>.</p>

<p>Click on the <img src="calibrate_button2.png"> toggle button again to
process the calibrated values and end calibration (this may take a few
seconds).</p>

<p>
Next you can adjust the <i>null zone</i>, <i>correction level</i>,
<i>dead zone</i>, and other parameters for that axis. If you are unsure
about what a parameter does, then you should look it up in the
definitions described in the
<a href="introduction.html#terminology">Introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <i>null zone</i> is depicted as a grey region near the center on
the axis gauge (shown below). The <i>dead zone</i> is shown only when
<i>correction level</i> is set to level 1 or greater, the <i>dead
zone</i> is depicted as a slightly thicker black bar parallel to the
ruler with two vertical bars representing the min and max bounds.
</p>

<img src="axis_gauge.png">

<p>
Adjust the <i>null zone</i> to cover the range where the arrow seems to
"fluctuate" when you are not touching the stick.
</p>

<p>
If the axis seems to give "erratic" values <u>when moved</u> in a range
near the center, then set the <i>correction level</i> to 1 (or higher)
and adjust the <i>dead zone</i> (both min and max) to cover this range.
Once you have the <i>dead zone</i> range set, you need to specify the
<i>correctional coefficient</i> for both the the min and max <i>dead
zone</i> ranges. A typical <i>correctional coefficient</i> would be 0.1,
decrease the <i>correctional coefficient</i> for a greater "dampening"
affect on the <i>dead zone</i>.
</p>



<a name="saving_calibration">
<h2>Saving Calibration</h2>

<p>
Once you are satisfied with the calibration, you should save it to
file. Simply go to Calibration-&gt;Save, the calibration will be saved
to the default calibration file found in your home directory.
</p>

<p>
Calibration for other devices found in that file (if it already exists)
will be preserved.
</p>

<p>
You can select another joystick device to calibrate from the
<i>joystick device prompt</i>, click on the popdown button and select
one from the list then press <code>ENTER</code>.
